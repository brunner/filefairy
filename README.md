# Filefairy and Fairylab

Automate a series of repetitive tasks relating to a friendly online competition
simulating a baseball league. Filefairy is the name of the app, and Fairylab is
the name of the website that the app deploys to.

Until late 2018, this project was not publicized and documentation not
considered necessary. It is now being prioritized, and will be finished by the
end of the year. In the meantime, please direct any questions to me personally,
and I will be more than happy to explain how this project works.
